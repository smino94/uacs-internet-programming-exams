## Application structure

The application should consist of the following pages:

- Author list page, available at `/authors`
- Author details page, available at `/authors/:id`
- Author edit page, available at `/authors/:id/edit`
- Author create page, available at `/authors/create`
- Statistics page, available at `/statistics`
- About page, available at `/about`
- ***Bonus***: Book create page, available at `/authors/:id/books/create`

Additionally, the application should have the following features:

- The home page should be the author list page
- The application should have a navigation bar that allows the user to navigate between the pages
- The application should have a footer that displays the current year, the student details (ID and name) and a link to the about page

### Author List Page

The author list page should display a list of authors, with the following information:

#### Data Format

- ID: The ID of the author
- Name: The name of the author
- Birth date: The birth date of the author in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Alive: A checkbox indicating whether the author is alive or not
- ***Bonus:*** Age, i.e. the difference in years between the birth date and the current date, or the death date and the birth date if the author is dead
- Nationality: The nationality of the author
- Bibliography: A number that indicates the number of books written by the author
- ***Bonus*** Years active: A string that indicates the years the author was active, in a `<startYear> - <endYear>` format. The start year will be the earliest year of publication of any of the author's books, and the end year will be the latest year of publication of any of the author's books. If the last publication year is the current year, or at most two years away from the current year, the end year should be "present". If the author is dead, the end year should be the year of death. Examples:
    - `1990 - 2015` - for a living author that has not published a book in the last two years
    - `1990 - present` - for a living author that has published a book in the last two years
    - `1990 - 2010` - for a dead author, where the year of death is 2010
- Actions: A list of actions that can be performed on the author, i.e. edit and delete

#### Sorting

All fields displayed should be sortable, i.e. clicking on the column header should sort the list by that column. The default sort order should be ascending, and clicking on the same column header again should reverse the sort order. The current sort order should be indicated by an arrow next to the column header. The arrow should point up for ascending order and down for descending order. If the column is not sorted, the arrow should not be displayed, or should be greyed out.

Note: The bibliography column should be sorted by the total number of books written by the author.
Note: The years active column should be sorted by the start year, then by the end year.

#### Filtering

The list should be filterable by the following fields:

- Name: The name of the author (free entry text box, with partial filtering)
- Nationality: Dropdowm list of nationalities (the list should be populated from the data)
- Alive: Checkbox indicating whether the author is alive or not

- Edit: Navigates to the author edit page
- Delete: Deletes the author from the list
- ***Bonus***: Add book: Navigates to the book create page
